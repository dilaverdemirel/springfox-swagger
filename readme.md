SWAGGER (OPENAPI) SPECIFICATION
The Swagger (OpenAPI) specification is a powerful definition format to describe RESTful APIs. The specification creates a RESTful interface for easily developing and consuming an API by effectively mapping all the resources and operations associated with it. Itâ€™s easy-to-learn, language agnostic, and both human and machine readable.
